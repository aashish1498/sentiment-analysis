The food was utterly atrocious. Ordered a pastrami sandwich that was insanely salty and so greasy it made the bread fall apart. It eventually made me sick. My girlfriend got a chicken wrap that had nasty store bought shredded cheese and what appeared to be an old wrap as it had a hard texture. Fries were tolerable. All in, not nearly worth the price we paid. Steer clear! Go anywhere else!
