So my wife and I waited approx 15 mins inside the restaurant to be seated, when the owner who was working a shift asked us if we would like to share a booth with the couple behind us whom we had never met. The individual behind us emphatically replied with a resounding NO!! I was rather insulted to be asked this after our wait as I found this to be a pure money mongering move.

Our orders arrived and shortly after I found a hair under one of the potatoes on my plate. Bringing this to the attention of my waitress, who was profusely apologetic, she delivered the plate to the owner with an explanation. After a few minutes he returned the plate explaining to me that bristles from brushes occasionally stick to the food consumed by patrons.

I found this to be completely unacceptable. Bristles should not be side orders to your meal. By the way, it was indeed a HAIR on my food, not a brush bristle. Either one would be unacceptable. The owner did not offer an apology, nor did he offer any other form of compensation.

I wasn’t looking for one…an apology would have been sufficient instead of the gruff and rude response I received as if it was my fault to notice the hair on my plate. This place is very overpriced …more than 50 dollars US for two breakfasts… and the owner does not display any respect for his patrons. Will never return!
