Awful. Service from start to finish was not good. Food was okay. Paid for a meal for 3, & immediately after finishing our food we were continuously asked to leave our table. When we said no (because we paid to be there) we were met with a guilt trip, rolled eyes, and heavy sighs.

Id understand if we had been there for a long time already, but we had not even been there for more than 35-40 minutes at this point. We still had coffee to finish and were waiting on an Uber to pick us up as well. Very unprofessional and rude.

As someone who has worked as a server, I understand the boundaries of overstaying at a table- but when a guest hasnâ€™t even been there for a full hour, and is still finishing items they paid money for, you leave them alone, or at the *very* least- ask politely.
