The place is horrible. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak and the thing was not edible. I am giving the place a 1 star because I couldn’t give it a 0 (zero) star. Don’t spend your money there. Street vendors foods are much tastier.
Their milkshake is not MILKSHAKE. It is milk with Hershey’s syrup. I am pretty sure they are not even using the Hershey’s brand but some much cheaper version: HORRIBLE PLACE. Avoid at all costs.
