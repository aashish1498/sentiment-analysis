The food was not very good quality and was overpriced. On top of that, there was dirt on top of the cans of soda and when we went to pay, the owner was having a phone conversation the entire time while at the counter and we had to wait until another person who worked there noticed this in order for us to pay for the food. It was overall a very bad experience.
